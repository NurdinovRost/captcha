Goal: 
train a captcha-solving model. any framework will work, pytorch is preferable
data annotation might be noisy, you should take this into account during training and evaluation

Metric: 
per-sample accuracy (percentage of samples, where all the characters match ground truth)

Output: 
1) per-sample accuracy estimate on provided test set
2) trained model weights
3) code for inference and metric measurement on private test set (dockerized version will get you extra points)
